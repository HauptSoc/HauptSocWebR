# 1. Cognitive labor and family-work conflict across Europe

In the first part of this large project, Dafna Gelbgiser and I wanted to know, what existing data can already tell us about the consequences of the unequal division of cognitive labor. We connected cognitive household labor with existing stress theories and asked whether men and women typically perform cognitive labor tasks that involve different levels of stress. We claim that women perform stressful tasks more often, making them more prone to higher levels of familyâ€“work conflict. We used large-scale survey data from 10 European countries within the Generations & Gender Programme (GGP) to test these claims empirically.
