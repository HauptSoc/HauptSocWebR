I'm a sociologist working at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. My research concerns reasons and consequences of economic inequality in modern societies. I published work about the relations of occupations to wage inequality, income richness, changes for low-income households, poverty, and the gender wage gap. More recent work concerns how to apply distributional methods properly.
