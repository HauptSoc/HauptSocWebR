abstract: "This paper discusses the crucial but sometimes neglected differences between unconditional
quantile regression (UQR) models and quantile treatment effects (QTE) models. We argue that
there is a frequent mismatch between the aim of the quantile regression analysis and the
quantitative toolkit used in much of the applied literature, including the motherhood wage
penalty literature. This mismatch may result in wrong conclusions being drawn from the data,
and in the end, misguided theories. In this paper, we clarify the crucial conceptual distinction
between influences on quantiles of the overall distributions, which we term population-level
influences, and individual-level QTEs. Further, we use data simulations to illustrate that various
classes of quantile regression models may, in some instances, give entirely different conclusions
(to different questions). Finally, we compare quantile regression estimates using real data
examples, showing that UQR and QTE models differ sometimes but not always. Still, the
conceptual and empirical distinctions between quantile regression models underline the need to
match the correct model to the specific research questions. We conclude the paper with a few
practical guidelines for researchers"
